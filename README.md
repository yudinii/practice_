[Wein f端r Sie](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aminov.alidzhon6857/viz/WineDashboard_17053558456560/Main_dashboard2) is a project that uses (000) data to recommend wines according to its type, origin, and pairing food based on wine data of (*data_source_link?*) - consisting of 60,000 different wines from 10,000 different regions.  
  
We intend `Wein f端r Sie` to serve as a easy and quick recommendation for daily wine selection for the people who love wines by using *machine learning algorithms?*. 
  
Here's an example of how the recommendation works:
